# ColoredTabLayout
From https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/blob/master/design/src/android/support/design/widget/TabLayout.java

I wanted a TabLayout with different colored indicators for each tab. Therefore: ColoredTabLayout.

The source I found at the above link seems to be different from what is found in the Android Design Library (v22), so there are some modifications to make it work with that.
